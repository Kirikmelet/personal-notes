# The Union Makes Us Strong

The Union Makes Us Strong.
These five words harken back to a different time; of when the unions formed, written in blood, to secure in the workplace, the unbreakable bond of the working class.

In the dawn of capitalism, the proletariat were exploited and subjugated by the industrial-bourgeois class, we were subject to long grueling hours, non-existent and/or pretend pay, poor living and working conditions.
But in spite of those injustices, the proletariat had enough, the first unions formed.
These union-members went on strike, bled on the streets (Haymarket Affair, Chicago, May 1886), and even fought with rifles against the likes of the Pinkertons and anti-union government (the Coal Wars, 1920s).
And because of people like them, the proletariat secured many concessions  in the struggle for labor, such as; the eight-hour workday and forty-hour workweek, labor day,  abolishment of child labor, the bargaining of fair wages, the campaign for safe workplaces, and the general welfare of workers.

In spite of rising inflation and living expenses, we have seen a resurgence in labor activism, from Amazon, auto-makers, and UPS; all the way to Starbucks, Trader Joe's, and our comrades in Hollywood; unions have secured better concessions than our non-unionized counterparts.
For example, the United Auto Workers went on a nationally publicized strike, and won concessions like a fifteen-dollar raise, concessions lost during the 2009 recession. But, it is not only the union workers who won them.
But also scabs and non-union workers who won their concessions too. 
And in another instance, the writers' strike in Hollywood - an area with an exorbitant cost-of-living - forced a new contract from the producers into ensuring a higher minimum of writers, a guideline for works created by artificial intelligence, and other such clauses. 

The union helps the community. This must not be forgotten, the union also helps in the general welfare of the people around the union members too. 
For example, our union - the UFCW Local 881 - serves the working folk of Illinois, and north-west Indiana. 
Union representatives are always available everyday and the union's presence is undeniable.  
With this fact, we are able to better serve our community better than our non-unionized counterparts. 
Thanks in part because we were able to collectively negotiate better conditions for ourselves.
After all, better working conditions, pay, and benefits like healthcare and retirement contribute to lower stress, a contributor to our interactions with our families and the greater community as a whole.
The union too, also helps the families of union members too. The children of the working members of Local 881, are eligible for scholar ships and other aid by the union, and also other unions and organizations in greater Chicago.
Hence, it is shown that solidarity of the working class extends beyond just our union, but we also help the other peoples around us too.

In conclusion, it is indisputable that the union, and the greater labor struggle, forms bonds between the proletariat, families, and communities as a whole. And so, we must continue to struggle, to "Organize the workers to control the use of their labor power".
