# The Union Makes Us Strong

The Union Makes Us Strong.
These five words harken back to a different time; of when the unions formed, written in blood, to secure in the workplace, the unbreakable bond of the working class.

In the dawn of capitalism, the proletariat were exploited and subjugated by the industrial-bourgeois class, we were subject to long grueling hours, non-existent and/or pretend pay, poor living and working conditions.
But in spite of those injustices, the proletariat had enough, the first unions formed.
These union-members went on strike, bled on the streets (Haymarket Affair, Chicago, May 1886), and even fought with rifles against the likes of the Pinkertons and anti-union government (the Coal Wars, 1920s).
And because of people like them, the proletariat secured many concessions  in the struggle for labor, such as; the eight-hour workday and forty-hour workweek, labor day,  abolishment of child labor, the bargaining of fair wages, the campaign for safe workplaces, and the general welfare of workers.

In spite of rising inflation and living expenses, we have seen a resurgence in labor activism, from Amazon, auto-makers, and UPS; all the way to Starbucks, Trader Joe's, and our comrades in Hollywood; unions have secured better concessions than our non-unionized counterparts.
For example, the United Auto Workers went on a nationally publicized strike, and won concessions like a fifteen-dollar raise, concessions lost during the 2009 recession.
