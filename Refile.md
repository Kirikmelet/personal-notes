## Quadratic Formula 二次方程式の解の公式

For $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the solution(s) is:
$$x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$
This is known as the **Quadratic Formula**.

## Rational Equations 有理方程式

Is an equation that only contains ratios contains ratios of [polynomials](https://google.com).

- $ax+b$ <- 1st degree polynomial, linear
- $ax^2+bx+c$ <- 2nd degree polynomial, quadratic
- $ax^3+bx^2+c$ <- 3rd degree polynomial, cubic

> [!warning] Warning!
> Division by zero is undefined!

1. Find all restricted values
2. Factor all denominators and find the LCD of all denominators
3. Multiply both sides by LCD (This will eliminate all fractions)
4. Solve the resulting equation

## Density versus Concentration of $NaCi$ Solutions

A relationship exists between density of a solution and its percent by mass, a concentration unit

This can be written as:

$$
\text{Percent by mass of a solution} = \frac{\text{mass of solute}}{\text{mass of solution}} \times 100\%
$$

alternatively also as:

$$
wt\% = \frac{\text{mass of solute}}{\text{mass of solution}} \times 100\%
$$

This relationship betweeen density and concentration makes a possible way to determine the unknown concentration of a solution/
This will be done by graphing a calibration curve. Therefore, once the relationship (calibration curve) is determined, you will calculate the unknown
concentration of a $NaCi$ solution

## Radical Equation

An equation that contains radicals. ie $(\sqrt[n]{a})^m$

> [!info] Solve
> $\sqrt{x+18}+2=x$

1. Isolate a radical on side by itself.
    $\sqrt{x+18}=x-2$
2. Raise both sides of the equation to the appropiate power to undo the isolated radical.
    $x+18=x^2-4x+4$
3. Repeat steps 1-3 is radicals remains.
4. Solve resulting equations.
5. **Check results**.

## Absolute Value

Absolute values are the distance between any number and zero.


### Consider

$|-4|=|-4-0|$ The distance between $-4$ and $0$ is equal to $4$
$|3|=|3-0|$ The distance between $3$ and $0$ is equal to $3$

### Absolute Value Theorum

If $|x|=a$ and $a>0$ then $x=a$ or $x=-a$
if $a<=0$ then can't use theorum to solve,
must solve via other means.
if $a<0$, there are no answers
if $a=0$, the answer is $0$.

#### Steps

1. Isolate an absolute value on side by itself.
2. Check $a>0$
3. Apply absolute value theorum

## More Quadratic Equations

An equation of a quadratic form $a[f(x)]+b[f(x)]+c=0$
where $f(x)$ is a function of x and we let $f(x)=u$,
where the equation becomess $au^2+bu+c$

## Atoms and Elements

The work *atoms* comes from the Greek **atomos**, meaning "indivisible"

Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is a technique that can image, and even move, individual atoms and molecules.

An atom is the smallest indetifiable unit of an element

There are about

- 91 different, naturally occuring elements.
- 20 synthetic elements

### Early Ideas about Manner

Leucippus and his student Democritus were the first to propose thaat matter were small atomic particles.
Plato and Aristotle did not embrace those ideas, instead believed  that matter had no smaller parts, and were
instead composed by the five "elements" (fire , wood, wind, water, metal).

### Law of Conservation of Mass

Law of conservation of mass states that in a chemical reaction, matter is neither created nor destroyed.

This law is consistant with the idea that matter is composed of small, indestructible, particles.

### Law of Definite/Constant Proportions.

All samples of a given compound, regardless of their source or how they were prepared, have the same proportions of their
constituent elements.

### Law of Multiple Proportions

When two elements form two different compounds, the masses of element one that combine with one gramme of element a can be expressed as a ratio 
of small whole numbers.

### Dalton's Atomic Theory

1. Each element is composed of tiny, indestructible particles called atoms.
2. All atoms of a given element have the same mass and other properties that distinguish them from the atoms of other elements.
3. Atoms combine in simple, whole-number ratios to form compounds.
4. Atoms of one lement cannot change into atoms of another element. In a chemical reaction, atoms only change the way that they are bound together
    with other atoms.

#### Isotopes

Isotopes are elements that contain same number of neutrons but not of protons.
This disputes Dalton's point 2. 

#### Ratio of Compounds

Very few ionic compounds are composed of fractional elements, thus disputing point 3.

### Discovery of the Electrons

Electrons were discovered by **Cathode Ray Tube**.

Electrons have the following properties:

- Follow straight line
- Negative charge
- etc.


### Plum and Pudding Model

J.J Thompson proposed that the negatively charged electrons were small particles were
balanced via plum and pudding model.


### Rutherford's Gold Foil Experiment

Rutherford found that most alpha particles passed through the gold foil, thus dissproving Thompson's model.
It is suggested that the particles were deflected by positvely charged "atom"
He was not able to determine the real structure of the element.

### Shadwick

Rutherford's student came up with the concept of "neutrons", this completes his teacher's, Rutherford, model.

### Neutrons

The mass of neutron is similar to that of a proton.

Neutrons has no electrical charge.

### Subatomic Particles

All atoms are composed of the same subatomic particles:

- Protons
- Neutrons
- Electrons

### Elements: Defined by their Numbers of Protons

Number of protons defines the element.

The number of protons in an atom's nucleus is its **atomic number** and given the symbol **Z**.

### Format of Isotopes

$$
\ce{^{2}_{7}N^{-}}
$$

#### Boron Neutron Capture Theory

Where boron is used to isolate certainc cells, and use thermal energy to kill it.

### Atomic Mass

$$
\text{atomic mass} = 
$$

1. Determine atomic mass of isotope
2. Find percentage of naturally occuring abundance.
3. Multiple all the percentages of the isotopes and its atomic mass.
4. Combine the results

> [!info] Example
> Determine atomic mass of $\ce{^{34.97}_{17}Cl}$ and $\ce{^{36.97}_{17}Cl}$,
> The first occurs 75.77% and the other 24.23% in the real world.
> $(\frac{75.77}{100} \times 34.97)+ (\frac{24.23}{100} \times 36.97)$
> $35.4546$
> Round down to $35.45\text{amu}$

### Periodic Tables

Transitional metals have properties that are not able to be predicted.

### Classification of Elements

There are three classifications of elements:

- Metals
- Nonmetals
- Metalloids

#### Metals

Metals are on the **lower-left** side and middle of the table.

They share the following properties:

- Good conductors of heat and energy
- Malleable
- Ductile
- Often shiny
- Tend to lose electrons during chemical change

##### Nonmetals

Nonmetals are on the **upper-right** of the table. There are only *17* of them.

- Five are solid at room temperature. ($C$, $P$, $S$, $Se$, and $I$)
- One is a liquid at room temperature. ($Br$)
- Eleven are gasses at room temperature. ($H$, $He$, $N$, $O$, $F$, $Ne$, $Cl$, $Ar$, $Kr$, $Xe$, and $Rn$)

#### Metalloids

Metalloids are sometimes called *semimetals*. These lie along the zig-zag diagonal line that divides metals and nonmetals.
Metalloids exhibit both properties.
Several metalloids are also classified as **semiconductors** because of their immediate and highly temperature depenedent
electrical conductivity.
