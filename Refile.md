# MTH121 Lecture 20240821

##### Square Root Principal

###### Example


1. $x^2=-4$
    
    1. Isolate the term being squared on one side
        
        $x^2=-4$
		
    3. Apply Square Root Principal 
        
        $x=\sqrt{-4}$ or $x=-\sqrt{-4}$

        $x=\sqrt{4 \times -1}$ or $x=-\sqrt{4 \times -1}$

        $x=\sqrt{4} \sqrt{-1}$ or $x=-\sqrt{4} \sqrt{-1}$

        $x=2i$ or $x=-2i$ ([1724250858-虚数](1724250858-虚数.md)を読める下さい)

##### Completing the Square

##### Example

1. $(x+3)^2$
    1. Complete with formula $x^2+2ax+(\frac{2ax}{2})^2$
      $x^2+6x+(\frac{2a}{2})^2$

## Matter, Measurement, and Problem Solving

### What is Chemistry?

Chemistry is the study of matter.

### What is Matter?

Matter is anything that occupies space and mass.

Matter invloves energy and changes associated with it.

The properties of matter are determined by the properties of molecules and atoms.

If you break down matter, molecules and atoms are found.

### Atoms and Molecules

Moleclules are comprised of atoms.
Molecules compose elements found in the periodic table.

Atoms and molecules determine how matter behaves; if different, matter would be different.

> [!info] Example
> The properties of water molecules determine how water behaves; properties of sugar effect sugar; etc.

The understanding of matter at the molecular level gives us unprecedented control over that matter.

Atoms are comprised of sub-atomic particles (electrons, protons, neutrons).

Atoms are usually mostly connected sans the last group of elements. 
The most unreactive elements are called noble gases. (He,Ne,etc.)
Atoms can be combined with another of itself or another atom.

A *molecule* is comprised of **2 or more atoms**.

If 2 different atoms of 2 different atoms are combined, they form a *compound*

Compounds are molecules, but are different than a molecule of elements.

> [!info] Example
> $He$ in an atom, not a molecule.
> $He_2$ is a molecule, but not a compound.
> $He_2O$ is a molecule and also a compound.

### Mixtures and Pure Chemical Substance

Pure Chemical Substance is a chemically bounded group of molecules (water).
Mixtures is a combined group of non-chemically bounded group of molecules (air)

Heterogeneous Mixtures are a mixture of non-uniform composition,
you **are not** able to see the boundaries of the compounds in the mixture.
Homogeneous Mixtures are a mixture of uniform composition,
you **are** able to see the boundaries of the compounds in the mixture.

> [!info] Fun Fact
> Milk is considered as a collidal solution.
