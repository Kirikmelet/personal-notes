## Quadratic Formula 二次方程式の解の公式

For $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the solution(s) is:
$$x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$
This is known as the **Quadratic Formula**.

## Rational Equations 有理方程式

Is an equation that only contains ratios contains ratios of [polynomials](https://google.com).

- $ax+b$ <- 1st degree polynomial, linear
- $ax^2+bx+c$ <- 2nd degree polynomial, quadratic
- $ax^3+bx^2+c$ <- 3rd degree polynomial, cubic

> [!warning] Warning!
> Division by zero is undefined!

1. Find all restricted values
2. Factor all denominators and find the LCD of all denominators
3. Multiply both sides by LCD (This will eliminate all fractions)
4. Solve the resulting equation
