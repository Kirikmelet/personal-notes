## Chemical Bonds

Compounds are composed of atoms held by **chemical bonds**

2 types:

- Ionic: mostly non-metal
- Covalent

### Ionic Bonds

Occur between metals and non-metals, invovle transfer of electrons from the metal atom to the nonmetal atom

The metal atom then becomes a **cation** while to nonmetal atom becomes an **anion**

Oppositely chargd together

### Covalent Bonds

Occur between two+ nonmetals, composing a molecule, also called **molecular compounds**.

## Chemical Formula

Know the chemical formula names:

- Water : Dihydrogen Monoxide : $\ce{H_{2}O}$
- Carbon Tetrachloride : $\ce{CCl_{4}}$

Tells you what elements are involved and the mole ratio.

> [!info] Example
> If one mole of $\ce{CO_{2}}$ contains two moles of oxygen and one mole of carbon.

Three types:

- Emperical Formula
- Molecular Formula
- Structural Formula

### Emperical Formula

Gives *relative number* of atoms of each element in a compund.

> [!info] Example
> Hydrogen Peroxide ($\ce{H_{2}O_{2}}$) is represented as $\ce{HO}$

To convert to molecular formula, finding the what $n$-th place is needed.

### Molecular Formula

Gives **actual number** of atoms of each element in a compound.


> [!info] Example
> Hydrogen Peroxide is represented as ($\ce{H_{2}O_{2}}$)

### Structural Formula

Represents how the molecule is structred in physical reality.

## Ionic Compounds

Ionic compounds are a cluster of ions, hence are not molecules.
Instead, refer to ionic compounds as **Formula Unit**

### Determening the formula from name (ionic bond)

Find the difference of both elements to nearest noble gas, switch charges.

> [!info] Example
> $\ce{Al^{3+}}+O^{2-}\rightarrow Al_{2}O_{3}$
> $\ce{Mg^{2+}}+Cl^{1-}\rightarrow Mg_{1}Cl_{2}$

### Finding the charge 

The charge of all the ions must be equal to zero.

> [!info] Example
> $\ce{FeCl_{3}}$ has $\ce{Fe}$'s charge equal to $3$, because $\ce{Cl}$ has
> difference from noble gas of $-1$, leading to the equation with $\ce{Fe}$'s ion as $x$,
> $\ce{Fe+Cl_{3} \rightarrow FeCl_{3}}$
>
> $x+3(-1)=0$
>
> $x-3=0$
>
> $x=3$
>
> $\ce{Fe(III)Cl_{3}}$


## Naming Ionic Compounds

## Type 1

Metal forms only one type of ion.

## Type 2

Metal forms more than two types of ion.
