# MTH141 Lecture 20240828

## Radical Equation

An equation that contains radicals. ie $(\sqrt[n]{a})^m$

> [!info] Solve
> $\sqrt{x+18}+2=x$

1. Isolate a radical on side by itself.
    $\sqrt{x+18}=x-2$
2. Raise both sides of the equation to the appropiate power to undo the isolated radical.
    $x+18=x^2-4x+4$
3. Repeat steps 1-3 is radicals remains.
4. Solve resulting equations.
5. **Check results**.

## Absolute Value

Absolute values are the distance between any number and zero.


### Consider

$|-4|=|-4-0|$ The distance between $-4$ and $0$ is equal to $4$
$|3|=|3-0|$ The distance between $3$ and $0$ is equal to $3$

### Absolute Value Theorum

If $|x|=a$ and $a>0$ then $x=a$ or $x=-a$
if $a<=0$ then can't use theorum to solve,
must solve via other means.
if $a<0$, there are no answers
if $a=0$, the answer is $0$.

#### Steps

1. Isolate an absolute value on side by itself.
2. Check $a>0$
3. Apply absolute value theorum

## More Quadratic Equations

An equation of a quadratic form $a[f(x)]+b[f(x)]+c=0$
where $f(x)$ is a function of x and we let $f(x)=u$,
where the equation becomess $au^2+bu+c$
