# Sean and Casper Action Plan

Aite so you guys need the following programs.


## Prerequisites

You're gonna need:

- Git
- NodeJS
- NPM
- A Text Editor (Visual Studio Code is a good basic one)

Here's a one-liner if you use Windows: `winget install Git.Git OpenJS.NodeJS Microsoft.VisualStudioCode`

## Technologies

You need working knowledge of :

- HTML + CSS + JS/TS
- NextJS
- TailwindCSS

Refer to the official documentation or AI for these

## Repository

I have a fork that you can use (https://github.com/Kirikmelet/hawks-code.github.io)

I suggest looking up how to use git first, but otherwise:

1. Open a terminal (Terminal), then go to wherever you have your projects at (I prefer `C:\Users\[User]\Projects\` or `/home/[User]/projects` if you're using \*NIX)
2. Clone the directory (`git clone https://github.com/Kirikmelet/hawks-code.github.io.git`)
3. Enter the directory (`cd hawks-code.github.io`)
4. git pull or fetch just in case (`git pull` `git fetch`)
5. When you've done doing stuff in this directory, you can list all changes with `git status`
6. Add whatever you've done by `git add [File/directory or whatever here]`
7. commit the git `git commit -m "[Message here, put whatever you like]"`, you can also have it open your editor and you can write the message there just by using `git commit`
8. Push the changes with `git push`

I'll add you as an external contributer. Because at the moment I'm not able to push changes to the main repository myself without Brandon's approval.
