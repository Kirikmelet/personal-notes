# Inverse Functions

- Denoted: $f^{-1}(x)$ read "f inverse of x"
- Only 1-to-1 functions have inverse functions (must pass vertical and horizontal line)
- Has property of "undoing" f

$f^{-1}$ is the inverse function of $f(x)$ if $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$ and $f^{-1}(f(x))=x$ where the domain of $f$ is the range of $f^{-1}$ is the domain of $f$

- if $f$ goes $(x,y)$ then $f^{-1}$ goes $(y,x)$.
- The graphs of $f^{-1}(x)$ and $f(x)$ are symmetric about the line $y=x$

```desmos-graph
y=x^2+1
x>=1
y=\sqrt{x-1}
