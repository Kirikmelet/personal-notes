## Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion Theory

Is a simple model to allow accounting for molecular shape

**Electron groups** are defined as lone pairs, single bonds, double bonds, and triple bonds.

VSEPR is based on idea that electron groups repel one another through coulombic forces.

Each bonds constitutes one electron group on a central atom, regardless.

The positions above and below the central atom are called axial positions. The positions in the same base plane as the central are called equatorial positions.

Equatorial positions are $120\degree$.
Axial and equatorial positions are $90\degree$

Formula for electron groups
$$AX_mE_n$$
Wherein:
- $A$: Central Atom
- $X$: Terminal Atom
- $E$: Lone Pair
