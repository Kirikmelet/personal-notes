## Rational Equations 有理方程式

Is an equation that only contains ratios contains ratios of [polynomials](https://google.com).

- $ax+b$ <- 1st degree polynomial, linear
- $ax^2+bx+c$ <- 2nd degree polynomial, quadratic
- $ax^3+bx^2+c$ <- 3rd degree polynomial, cubic

> [!warning] Warning!
> Division by zero is undefined!

1. Find all restricted values
2. Factor all denominators and find the LCD of all denominators
3. Multiply both sides by LCD (This will eliminate all fractions)
4. Solve the resulting equation

## Density versus Concentration of $NaCi$ Solutions

A relationship exists between density of a solution and its percent by mass, a concentration unit

This can be written as:

$$
\text{Percent by mass of a solution} = \frac{\text{mass of solute}}{\text{mass of solution}} \times 100\%
$$

alternatively also as:

$$
wt\% = \frac{\text{mass of solute}}{\text{mass of solution}} \times 100\%
$$

This relationship betweeen density and concentration makes a possible way to determine the unknown concentration of a solution/
This will be done by graphing a calibration curve. Therefore, once the relationship (calibration curve) is determined, you will calculate the unknown
concentration of a $NaCi$ solution
