Buford was sent by his father to Bloxia to study military theory from the Commonwealth Military Academy.

Buford sided with the revolutionary army and retained his rank in the Noobic Republic's Army. Buford suffered a deliberating injury by a Bloxian artillery shell in the Defense of Minerva (1952), which lead to his discharge from the 1st Noobic Division, but due to his heroism, lead to his appointment by the Stratocratic government to lead the then newly-established Noobic Military Police.
