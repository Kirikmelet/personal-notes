**Parachute Challenge Lab Overview**

Let’s challenge our new lab skills! In this lab series we will answer the question, “what affects the time it takes a parachute to fall?” This question may sound familiar – you have already studied this! But there’s a twist: you’ll be in a competition with your peers to create a parachute with the largest fall time AND there’s something attached to the parachute:

- Online Students will attach a 25 g mass (10 pennies, 5 nickels or 11 dimes weighs close enough to 25 grams)
- In case you wondered, in-person students attach a plastic army dude and a steel washer to theirs. :)

Any real-world project has restrictions and specifications which may include completion deadlines, performance criteria, and a limited amount of material. During this lab, you must design and build the best parachute with these limitations:

- Material: 10 sheets of paper MAX, 2 feet of string MAX, and 24 inches of tape MAX (you may use staples with my permission - we need to meet over zoom to talk details beforehand if you want staples)
- Drop height (where parachutist starts) must be 7 feet
- A video must be uploaded to Pivot Interactives with a ruler in the proper place in the video (more details on that in an item below these instructions)
- Video must be uploaded in real time (not slow motion)

**What To Do**

Make a parachute that follows the rules for construction written above. Add the weight to the parachute.

Set up a video filming area where you can record the parachute falling all 7 feet (more tips on this below).

Record your parachute and upload video to Pivot Interactives.

Measure the time it took to fall using Pivot tools and record in the Pivot Interactive.

Repeat with 2 more parachutes. Try to get an A+ and to beat your peers!

**Grading**

- You must upload 3 parachutes to the Pivot linked below
- Pivot videos must follow the ruler rules detailed below this instruction set and be in real time (not slow motion)
- I must be able to see the entire flight of your parachute, from top to floor
- Your 3 parachutes must look obviously different from each other - ideally you'll have 1 parachute, then try a 2nd one that improves on it, then try a 3rd that improves on the 2nd. :)
- I'll be grading the 3rd parachute uploaded to Pivot and scores will be as listed below:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Parachute Time From Drop To Landing**|**Score**|
|<0.700 s|0|
|0.701 - 0.750 s|75%|
|0.751 - 0.850 s|85%|
|0.851- 0.999 s|95%|
|>1.000 s|100%|
|1st place in section|+5%|
|2nd place in section|+3%|

For fairness, any parachutes entered after the deadline in the planner will not be part of the 1st or 2nd place in section competition.
