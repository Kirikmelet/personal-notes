# Elizabeth Stevens

Elizabeth Stevens (1941-) is the estranged twin-sister of Annabelle Stevens (1941-), born out to a Noobic mother and a Bloxian father. A wave of Bloxiphobia caused her family to split; her father and twin-sister fled to Bloxia, while Elizabeth and mother remained in the city of Springfield. Elizabeth graduated from the Noobic Military Police Cadet Academy in 1959, and was assigned to the Naramo Nuclear Power Plant in the Naramo District. In 1961, Elizabeth and other NMP officers were given orders to bolster the Naramo Facility Security Force. She is a Patrol Officer of the Noobic Military Police  and was formerly a Field Operative of the Naramo Facility Security Force before its sudden dissolution just before the Raid of the Naramo Nuclear Power Plant (1963). Elizabeth Stevens is a reservist infantryman of the 3rd Noobic Division, owing to a requirement for being a Noobic Military Police officer. She is permanently garrisoned in the Naramo Nuclear Power Plant situated in the Naramo District of the Noobic Stratocracy.

 She was deployed alongside local security forces, local 1st Noobic Division garrison, and the 13th Armored Cavalry Regiment and infantry elements of the 3rd Noobic Division and 1st Noobic Fleet against the 21st Infantry Regiment of the West Noobic Federal Ground Defense Force and Bloxian advisors from the 171st Infantry Regiment.
