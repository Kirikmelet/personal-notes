# Annabelle Stevens

Annabelle Stevens (1942-), also known as Anna, was a Lance Corporal of the Bloxian Army Corps (BAC). Annabelle was born in the rural city of Mellowfield, Emerald Eard, to a poor peasent-class family. Despite the wave of pacifism in the Bloxian populace, Annabelle enlisted in the BAC in hopes of securing a stable future for her and her parents. 

Annabelle is an enforcer in the Bloxian Gendarmerie Command attached to the 171st Infantry Regiment. Furthermore, Annabelle saw deployment in the raid of the Naramo Nuclear Power Plant during the Noobic Reunification War (1962-1967) as part of an expeditionary unit of the 171st Infantry Regiment alongside the 21st Infantry Battalion of the (West) Noobic Self Defense Force against the local 1st Noobic Division garrison alongside the 14th Armored Cavalry Regiment and infantry elements of the 3rd Noobic Division and naval infantry of the 1st Noobic Fleet.
