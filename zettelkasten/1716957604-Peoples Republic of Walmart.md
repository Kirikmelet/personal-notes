# Peoples Republic of Walmart

## 解題

## 引く

> “I pay low wages,” said founder Sam Walton. “I can take advantage of that. We’re going to be successful, but the basis is a very low-wage, low-benefit model of employment.”  (p. 12)

> Even arch-capitalist America is home not only to Walmart and Amazon, but also to the Pentagon: in spite of being incredibly destructive, the US Department of Defense is the single-largest employer in the world, and a centrally planned public sector operation. In fact, almost all countries are mixed economies that include various combinations of markets and planning. (p. 17)

> Yet if the market is conclusively, unassailably, incontestably the
optimum mechanism for the allocation of goods and services, then why
have the economies of Western nations continued to experience
mismatches between what is produced and what is required—
mismatches that have led to severe recessions and near-catastrophic
economic crises since 1991? Why was the global economy barely (and
likely temporarily) saved from a Depression-scale collapse in investment
in 2008, not by market mechanisms, but as a result of (modest)
Keynesian pump priming? What is the source of economic stagnation
since the Great Recession? Why, after three decades of steady decreases
in inequality in the West in the post-war period leading up to the 1970s,
has inequality in the developed countries grown over the last forty years,
triggering an explosion in popular anger, along with hard-right reaction,
in country after country? Why has infrastructure crumbled and
innovation stalled? Why can’t the market resolve what is perhaps the
greatest threat to modernity, microbial resistance to antibiotics—a
situation that risks casting medicine back to the Victorian era—whereas
a public sector effort likely could? And why can’t the market, left to its
own devices, meet the civilizationally existential challenge of climate
change (p. 24-25)

> Mises went beyond what by this period was already a
longstanding ethical argument against socialism: that under such a
system, there would be no incentive to work and therefore no drive
toward excellence. In this short text, Mises instead posed the following
questions: In any economy larger than the primitive family level, how
could socialist planning boards know which products to produce, how
much of each should be produced at each stage, and which raw
materials should be used and how much of them? Where should
production be located, and which production process was most efficient?
How would they gather and calculate this vast array of information, and
how could it then be retransmitted back to all actors in the economy? (p. 27)

> No human
process could possibly gather all the necessary data, assess it in real
time, and produce plans that accurately describe supply and demand
across all sectors. Therefore, any economy the size of an entire country
that tried to replace the myriad decisions from the multitude of
sovereign consumers with the plans of bureaucrats working from
incorrigibly flawed data would regularly produce vast, chasm-like
mismatches between what is demanded and what is supplied. These
inefficiencies would result in such social and economic barbarities—
shortages, starvation, frustration and chaos—that even if one accepts the
inevitability of inequalities and attendant myriad other horrors of
capitalism, the market will still appear benign by comparison.
Meanwhile, Mises argued that the extraordinarily simple mechanism
of prices in the market, reflecting the supply and demand of resources,
already contains all this information. Every aspect of production—from
the cost of all inputs at all times, to the locations of inputs and products,
and the changing demands and taste of purchasers—is implicitly
captured by price.
But if prices in the market are so much more uncomplicated,
effortless and manageable, then why don’t we just stick with them?
Mises’s argument in his 1920 essay, later developed through a series
of books, is described to this day by his acolytes as his masterpiece. And
not without reason: it is perhaps the strongest argument ever mounted
against the idea of socialism. How, indeed, could we replace prices with
planning boards? And isn’t socialism supposed to be direct rule by the
workers, rather than a replacement of unelected bosses with remote
bureaucrats? If centralized by bureaucrats, how could all that
information be gathered? And if decentralized, how could all those
millions (and globally, billions) of workers democratically coordinate
production decisions? (p. 27)
