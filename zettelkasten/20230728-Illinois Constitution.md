The general election occurs on the Tuesday following the first Monday of November in even-numbered years.

    The State of Illinois is divided into 59 Legislative Districts that are required to be compact, contiguous, and substantially equal in population. One senator is elected to the General Assembly from each legislative district. Each legislative district also contains two representative districts. In the year following each Federal decennial (occurring every 10 years) census, the General Assembly is required to redistribute legislative districts and representative districts in a process called redistricting.
- **Legislative Redistricting** _Article IV: Section 3_  
    The Federal Government conducts the Decennial U.S. Census (the "Population and Housing Census") once every 10 years.

#### The Illinois General Assembly

Article Four, Section Two ("Legislative Composition") of the Illinois Constitution states the requirements to be a member of the State's General Assembly. To be eligible, persons must be:

- A United States citizen
- Be twenty-one age of years at a minimum
- A resident of the district the person represents for two years prior to the election or appointment.

The General Assembly has presiding officers in both the Senate and the House of Representatives who lead sessions.

The Senate elects the President of the Senate, this officers is elected from within the Senate, therefore is usually a member of the majority party in the Senate.

The House of Representatives elects the Speaker, this officers is elected from within the House of Representatives, and is usually the leader of the majority party in the House of Representatives.

### The Governor

The Governor of the State of Illinois not only is able to wield the normal veto process, but also is able to wield a special form of veto call the **item veto**. This veto power applies only to items of appropriations in bills presented to the governor by the Illinois General Assembly.

Article Four, Section Nine, Clause D of the Illinois State Constitution reads:

> The Governor may reduce or veto any item of appropriations in a bill presented to him. Portions of a bill not reduced or vetoed shall become law. An item vetoed shall be returned to the house in which it originated and may become law in the same manner as a vetoed bill.

Appropriations refers to the use of state monies. This means the Governor may choose to reduce/remove and item the sets an amount of state money the Illinois General Assembly would like to spend from a proposed law.

If the Governor uses the item veto, the rest of the bill will pass as is written. Only the item vetoed returns back to the Illinois General Assembly, to the house where the bill began. 

As with other vetoes, the Illinois General Assembly may choose to override an item veto. However this item veto requires only a majority of the members elected to each house to vote in favor of restoring the item to the bill, thereby adding it to law.

The Governor of Illinois has another choice when they are presented with a bill from the Illinois General Assembly: they can choose to make recommendations (Article Four, Section Nine, Clause E). In this case, the Governor can return the bill with specific recommendations for change to the house in which the bill began.

If a bill is returned with recommendations, the Illinois General Assembly can accept those recommendations by a recorded vote of a majority of the members elected to each house.

If the Illinois General Assembly chooses to accept the recommendations the Governor has made through a majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, it returns the bill to the Governor. If the Governor certifies that the returned document conforms to their recommendations, the bill becomes law. If the Governor does not certify that the returned document conforms to their recommendations, the bill is returned again to the house in which it began, but as a vetoed bill.

### Checks and Balances

Article Four, Section Fourteen of the Illinois Constitution gives the Illinois House of Representatives the sole power to conduct legislative investigation to determine whether a member of the Executive or Judicial branches has conducted wrongdoing sufficient enough to result in impeachment (formal charges by the House of Representatives).

If the House of Representatives determines there is cause for impeachment, an impeachment trial is held in the Senate. If the Governor is the elected official tried for impeachment, the Chief Justice of the Illinois Supreme Court presides over the trial. The member of the Executive or Judicial branch is removed from office an disqualified to hold any other public office of the State of Illinois if two-thirds of the Senate votes there is enough evidence to find the elected official guilty of the charges.

Members of the Illinois General Assembly are not subject to impeachment proceedings.

However, each house has the authority to expel one of its own members with a vote of two-thirds of the members elected that house

> Note-taker's note: This is where I think Marxism-Leninism's idea of "Right of Recall" and Democratic Centralism is superior.

State legislatures can apply to the United States Congress to request a convention for proposing amendments to the United States Constitution and can ratify amendments to the United States Constitution.

Article V of the U.S. Constitution provides Congress the authority to propose amendments to the U.S. Constitution, but it also allows the legislatures of the states to require a Federal Constitutional Convention for proposing amendments if two-thirds of the state legislatures apply to Congress for a convention. Article V of the U.S. Constitution also outlines that one method of ratifying amendments to the U.S. Constitution is by action of three-fourths of state legislatures or by conventions called in three-fourths of the states.

Article XIV, Section 4 of the Illinois Constitution specifies that three-fifths of the members elected to both houses of the Illinois General Assembly are required to vote to approve a request for a Federal Constitutional Convention, to ratify a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution, or to call a State Convention to ratify a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

## Lesson Four

This lesson concerns the State Executive Branch and our executive officials.

The Illinois Executive Branch is responsible for ensuring the Illinois government carries out and enforces the laws created by the Illinois General Assembly. The Illinois Executive Branch includes several recognizable state elected officials, such as our Governor and Lieutenant Governor. The Executive Branch also includes our state agencies that carry out a variety of public services which impact our daily lives.

The following terms will help in understanding Article V of the Illinois Constitution.

The order of succession to the Office of the Governor is: the Lieutenant Governor, then the Attorney General, and then the Secretary of State.
- **Malfeasance** _Article V: Section 10_  
    Wrongdoing or misconduct by a public official.
- **Prescribed** _Article V: Sections 14-16_  
    Illinois law prescribes certain duties to Elected Officials. To prescribe means to state, with authority, that some action must be carried out.
- **Pardon** _Article V: Section 12_  
    The Governor may grant a pardon to someone convicted of a crime in Illinois. A pardon completely forgives a crime and erases any punishment entirely.
- **Reprieve** _Article V: Section 12_  
    The Governor may grant a reprieve to someone who is incarcerated (held in custody) in Illinois. A reprieve refers to the postponement of a punishment or penalty.
- **Supreme Executive Power** _Article V: Section 8_  
    "The Governor shall have the supreme executive power, and shall be responsible for the faithful execution of the laws." In other words, this places the Governor of Illinois at the head of the Illinois Executive Branch.

### Executive Officers

The Executive Branch has six elected Executive Officers an some appointed officers. These officers are as follows:

1. Governer
2. Lieutenant Governer
3. Attorney General
4. Secretary of State
5. Comptroller, and
6. Treasurer

To be eligible, citizens must be:

- A United States citizen.
- Twenty-five years of age at a minimum.
- A resident of Illinois for at least three years preceding the election.

The Governor's office may become vacated for a variety of reasons when the Governor is incapacitated due to:

- Death
- Conviction on impeachment
- Failure to qualify for position
- Resignation, and/or
- Other disabilities (permanent/temporary)

If vacant, there exists a chain of succession. These are as follows.

1. Governor
2. Lieutenant Governor
3. Attorney General
4. Secretary of State

If the other offices are vacant or the candidate fails to qualify, the Governor has the authority to appoint persons to the empty offices in question. This appointee holds the office until the elected candidate qualifies or another election is held.

If the Office of Lieutenant Governor becomes vacant or the candidate for the office fails to qualify, the Office remains vacant until the end of term.

Non-elected officers are nominated by the office by the governor per Article Five, Section Nine of the Illinois Constitution. These nominees are approved by the Senate by a majority vote.

Governors may also remove an official appointed to office for one of three reasons per Article Five, Section Ten of the Illinois Constitution, these reasons are as follows:

- Incompetance
- Neglect of Duty, or
- Malfeasance

The powers of Governor of Illinois differ from those of the President of the United States in these following reasons:

- The Governor may only nominate some officials in the State Executive Branch, the President may nominate all members.
- The President may nominate all federal judges, the Governor does not have this power, nor are they able to appoint judges.
- The Governor may use the power of the item veto in appropriation bills, the President may note

## Lesson Five

The lesson concerns Article Six of the Illinois Constitution. Specifically, the Judiciary, an the system of courts and Judges.

The Judicial Branch concerns the interpretation of laws and its application in court cases. This branch also determines whether Illinois laws follow or break the guidelines of the Illinois Constitution.

The terms may help in understanding Article Six of the Illinois Constitution:

- **Appeal** _Article VI: Sections 4 and 6_  
    In legal terms, an appeal is when an individual applies to a higher court — such as an Appellate Court — to reverse the decision of a lower court.
- **Habeas Corpus** _Article VI: Section 4_  
    In legal terms, habeas corpus is a writ requiring that a person held in custody must be brought before a court to determine the legality of their detention. Literally, "habeas corpus" translates to "You shall have the body" - meaning the Judge must see the person being held in custody. Habeas corpus is a right expressly protected in our Illinois Constitution, as well as in the U.S. Constitution. This acknowledgement grants us protection against unlawful and indefinite imprisonment by guaranteeing each prisoner the ability to demonstrate that their right to a fair trial was denied before a Judge, in order to determine whether their imprisonment was lawful.
- **Judicial Circuits/Circuit Courts** _Article VI: Sections 7-8_  
    Trial courts that span one or more counties.
- **Judicial District** _Article VI: Section 2_  
    The State of Illinois is divided into five judicial districts which elect Illinois Supreme Court and Appellate Court Judges.
- **Mandamus** _Article VI: Section 4_  
    A writ in which a person asks the court to order a public officer to carry out their duties.
- **Original Jurisdiction** _Article VI: Sections 4, 6, and 9_  
    In legal terms, original jurisdiction refers to a court's power or right to hear a case for the first time.
- **Prohibition** _Article VI: Section 4_  
    In a case related to prohibition, a person asks the Supreme Court to forbid a lower court from trying a case that should be tried in another court. For example, John Doe does not want Judge Parker to hear his case because Judge Parker has a vested interest in, or personal connection to, the case. However, Judge Parker refuses to excuse himself from the case. Therefore, John Doe will go to the Supreme Court to request a writ that prohibits Judge Parker from hearing the case.
- **Quorum** _Article VI: Sections 3 and 5_  
    A quorum refers to the minimum number of participants in a group that is required to be present in order to make the group's meetings valid. In the case of the Supreme Court of Illinois, a quorum is four of the seven judges, as we will learn later.
- **Revenue** _Article VI: Section 4_  
    Cases related to revenue are ones that deal with tax matters.
- **Writ** _Related to Article VI: Section 4 (Mandamus, Habeas Corpus)_  
    A formal legal document ordering or prohibiting some action.

### Judicial Branch

The State of Illinois'  Judicial Branch is divided into five Judicial Districts. The first district only serves Cook County. The remaining four five counties divided on an substantially equal population and must be compact and composed of contiguous counties.

The Illinois Constitution also divides the Judicial Branch into three types of Courts. These are:

- Supreme Court
- Appellate Courts (where appeals are heard)
- Circuit Courts (for most trials)

### Illinois Supreme Court

The Illinois Supreme Court is the supreme or highest court in the State of Illinois. The State Constitution gives the Illinois Supreme court original jurisdiction - the right to hear a case before any other court does - in a few specific types of court cases:

1. **Revenue** - cases related to tax matters
2. **Mandamus** - cases asking the Supreme Court to require a public official to carry out their duties
3. **Prohibition** - cases asking the Supreme Court to forbid a lower court from trying a case that should be tried in another court
4. **Habeas Corpus** - cases asking the Supreme Court to determine the legality of a prisoner's detention, to demonstrate that their right to a fair trial was denied.

The Illinois Supreme Court can choose to exercise their original jurisdiction — or right to hear these types of cases first — or can allow a lower court to hear the case. The Illinois Supreme Court is also the highest appellate court in Illinois. The Illinois Supreme Court has the authority to hear cases appealed to it from the Circuit Courts or Appellate Courts.

Judges elected to the Supreme Court serve ten year terms.

### Appellate Courts

Appellate Courts hear appeals from the Circuit Courts in their Judicial District and division. Each Appellate Court has the right to hear appeals on final judgments from the Circuit Courts located in their Judicial District, unless the case is appealable directly to the Illinois Supreme Court or unless no appeal is made.

There are five Judicial Districts in Illinois. There is at least one Appellate Court division for each Judicial District. Within each Judicial District, the Illinois Supreme Court can choose to prescribe (assign) more Appellate Court divisions for each Judicial District. Currently there are ten total Appellate Court divisions — six in the First District (Cook County) and one each in every other district.

The final number of Appellate Court judges for each Judicial District is determined by Illinois State Law. Each Appellate Court division in Illinois must have at least three Judges. Currently, there are 54 appellate court judges in Illinois.

Some Appellate Court judges are elected by voters in their Judicial Districts. When elected, Appellate Court judges serve 10-year terms initially and may be retained for additional 10-year terms.

Other Appellate Court judges are assigned to the appellate court by the Illinois Supreme Court.

Once elected or assigned, the Appellate Court divisions each select a presiding judge for a one-year term. That presiding judge selects panels of three judges per panel to hear individual appeals.

### Circuit Courts

Circuit Courts have **original jurisdiction** — or the right to hear a case before any other court does — in almost all cases. Circuit Courts only lose the right to original jurisdiction if the Supreme Court decides to exercise its right to original jurisdiction over revenue, mandamus, prohibition, and habeas corpus. Circuit courts are the courts we, as citizens, are likely to be most familiar with.

The State of Illinois is divided into Judicial Circuits of one or more counties. There are 24 Judicial Circuits in the State of Illinois, of which six are single county circuits (Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will). Each Judicial Circuit has one Circuit Court, and each Circuit Court has at least one Circuit Judge.

Circuit Courts are served by Circuit Judges and Associate Judges. Circuit Court judges are elected by voters in their Judicial Circuit to serve a six-year initial term. They may also be retained for additional six year terms. As Illinois Courts noted, Circuit Court judges can hear any Circuit Court case and have general administrative authority for their circuit.

In order to qualify to be a circuit judge, citizens must be:

- A United States citizen.
- A practicing attorney in Illinois.
- Properly licensed with State Bar.
- A resident of area from which selected/elected.

Associate judges are appointed by Circuit Court judges for four-year terms. As Illinois Courts noted, Associate judges are not allowed to preside over felony cases without approval from the Illinois Supreme Court.

### Jury Duty

Illinois citizens have the right to a trial by jury. That means we, as Illinois citizens, may be asked to serve on a jury of our peers during a trial.

Jury members have an important, sacred role in a trial. As the Illinois State Bar Association states in their Guide to Jury Service:

The [Illinois Jury Act (705 ILCS 305/)](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=1860&ChapterID=50) sets the qualifications for members of a jury. According to the Jury Act, jurors must be:

- A resident of the county where the court is located/trial is held,
- Age 18 or older,
    - Able to understand the English language (whether in spoken form, written form, or interpreted into sign language), and
- A United States citizen (705 ILCS 305/2)

Convicted felons may not be eligible for jury service, depending on the nature of the felony crime and the age of the crime.

If aske to serve on a jury, citizens have a responsibility to serve (with some exemptions for hardship). Remember that under the law, citizens are protected against employer harassment and from being fired for responding to jury service.

- **Liabilities** _Article VIII: Section 2_  
    In financial terms, liabilities are a type of obligation that may be short-term or long-term. Liabilities still refer to an outstanding debt that is owed and could be paid with money (financial) or perhaps with goods and services (non-financial).

- **Nongraduated income tax** _Article IX: Section 3_  
    A graduated income tax is one in which the tax rate increases as earnings increase. In other words, the more money an individual or a business makes, the higher their tax rate would be. A graduated tax rate is also known as a progressive tax, because it allows lower- and middle-income taxpayers with less expendable income to shoulder a smaller tax burden. The federal government has a graduated tax rate. The State of Illinois has a nongraduated income tax, which means our state income tax rate does not increase as our earnings increase. Instead, the State of Illinois uses a flat income rate tax, where everyone pays the same percentage of their income as tax. A nongraduated tax is also known as a regressive tax, because individuals pay the same tax rate regardless of ability to pay.

It is easiest to think of personal property as the things that we own that we can move, such as our household goods, furniture, electronics, cars, and our financial wealth such as money, stocks, and bonds. In contrast, real property includes land or things attached to land, such as our homes.
- **Real Property** _Article IX: Section 4_  
    The things we own that have value (assets) that include land or any permanent improvements to land. It is easiest to think of this as the property we own that cannot be moved, such as the land our house is on, our house itself or other buildings on our land, and improvements that we have made to our house (e.g., driveways, fencing, sewage systems).

- **Sovereign Immunity** _Article XIII: Section 4_  
    In areas with sovereign immunity, the government cannot be sued without its consent. The Illinois Constitution abolishes sovereign immunity in Article XIII, Section 4, except where the General Assembly provides it by law.

    Units of local government include counties, municipalities, townships (a division of a county), special districts, and units designated as units of local government by law. Units of local government do not include school districts.

### Local Government

Article Seven of the Constitution of the State of Illinois outlines the units of local government in the State and their powers. 

The State of Illinois is divided into 102 counties, each with their own government. Other such units include; municipalities (cities, villages, towns), townships (county division), special districts, and units designated as units of local government by law.

Units of local government generally have limited powers. 
Generally, unites who qualify for home rule may pass ordinances to protect public health, safety, moral, and welfare; license business; collect taxes; incur debt. If a county has an elected chief executive officer or a municipality has a population of more than 25000 people, it is automatically considered a home rule unit. Other municipalities can also elect, by **referendum**, to become a home rule unit.

State government take precedence over local governments.

Citizens may be involved in local governments by voting in **consolidated elections** held every two years, in odd numbered years. In those elections, citizens vote for officials such as city board members, town library directors, high commissioners, and et cetera. Attendance for consolidated elections tends to be much lower than that of general elections.

### Finance

Article Eight of the Illinois Constitution concerns State finances (public funds, public property, public credit).

Public funds, property, credit must be used for public purposes per Article Eight, Section One of the Illinois Constitution.

Only the Illinois General Assembly has the authority to determine how public funds should be spent. 
Each year, the Governor reports to the General Assembly about the estimated amount of money coming into the state treasury and prepares a budget reporting to the General Assembly how the Governor plans to spend with the aforementioned money.  
The Governor's recommended budget cannot plan to spend more than what the state will be getting. When the General Assembly approves a final budget, their appropriations (money they plan to spend) cannot exceed the amount of money the General Assembly believes will be available during the fiscal year.

Article Eight, Section 3 of the Illinois Constitution requires and **audit** of the state's spending at the end of the fiscal year by the Auditor General. The Auditor General is appointed by the General Assembly through a *three-fifth* vote in each house, and serves for 10 years. 
The Auditor General's audit determines whether state money was spent appropriately. 
Once the audit is complete each fiscal year, the Auditor General provides a report of their findings to the General Assembly and the Governor.

### Revenue (Taxes)

Article Nine of the Illinois Constitution concerns state revenue, of which includes income tax and real property taxed paid for each tax season.

The State of Illinois uses a **nongraduated income tax** in the form of a flat tax. This means every citizen pays the same percentage of income tax, after exemptions and deductions, regardless of the amount of money they make. The nongraduated income tax was first set for Illinois citizens and business by the Illinois Constitution of 1970.

If a person, working within the United States, has had a paycheck, they would notice that a portion of their paycheck has been set aside for both state and federal taxes. 
The portion of their paycheck that is set aside for state taxes is for the State of Illinois' nongraduated income tax, as well as any local tax that the State of Illinois collects and distributes to local governments.

Business and corporations pay income tax as well. Article Nine, Section Three of the Illinois Constitutions grants the General Assembly the power to set a different income tax rate for individual citizens than for corporations and businesses.

Real Property Tax is what we commonly call "property tax". As we know, real property refers to the land or any permanent improvements to land (including homes and other buildings) that we own that have value. We might also hear this referred to as "real estate". Therefore, real property tax is a tax applied to the value of this real estate. 

Article Nine, Section Five of the Illinois Constitution abolished personal property tax.

If an individual does not pay their state taxes, and they own real property in Illinois, the could be subject to a tax sale (Article Nine, Section Eight). 
During a tax sale, the unpaid tax debt on the individual's home would be sold to the highest bidder. 
The individual that owns the home would then have two years to "redeem" the real estate, which means to pay off the overdue taxes.

> Note-taker's Note: This would disappropriately affect persons of lower-income more 

If they don't redeem the real estate by paying off the overdue taxes, the winning bidder from the sale can petition for a tax deed to become the new owner of the home.

It is important to know that tax sales cannot occur without a court hearing.
The court must rule in favor of taking the property, but they must give the individual owner and any other occupants of the home reasonable notice of the tax sale and information on when the period of redemption (the time during which the individual can buy back the house by paying off the unpaid taxes) will end.

The State of Illinois is allowed to carry debt in certain cases by Article Nine, Section Nine of the Illinois Constitution. The most common form of debt that the State of Illinois and its agencies could owe is a bond, as bonds are often used to raise money. To incur a debt, the General Assembly must pass a law with a three-fifths vote of both houses or the majority of electors must approve the debt at the next general election. Article IX, Section 9 of the Illinois Constitution sets limits on the amount of debt the State of Illinois can carry for general needs (no more than 5% of state appropriations during a fiscal year) and for emergencies (no more than 15% of state appropriations for the fiscal year).

### Education

Article Ten of the Illinois Constitution guarantees the right to high-quality education. Specifically, Article Ten, Section One of the Illinois Constitution sets out the fundamental goal of "The education development of all persons to the limits of their capacities."

The State of Illinois is responsible for creating "and efficient system of high quality public educational institutions and services" (Article Ten, Section One). The Illinois Constitution requires that education in public schools through the secondary level be free, and allows for the General Assembly to provide other free education by law. Therefore, the State of Illinois has the primary responsibility for creating and paying for our K-12 public system of education.

Article Ten of the Illinois Constitution requires the creation of the Illinois State Board of Education, which plans and determines what students in the state's public education system should learn.

Article Ten, Section Three of the Illinois Constitution prohibits the use of public funds for sectarian purposes. This section forbids the General Assembly, counties, cities, towns, townships, school districts, or other public organizations from using public funds or resources for religious purposes.

### Environment

Article Eleven of the Illinois Constitution concerns the environment.

Both The State of Illinois and each of its citizens has a duty to keep their natural environment safe and healthy for the current and future generations. The Illinois General Assembly is tasked with creating laws to help keep the environment healthy. The [Illinois Environment Protection Agency](https://www2.illinois.gov/epa/Pages/default.aspx) provides ways for citizens to help care for the environment both in the workplace and at home.


### Militia

Article Twelve of the Illinois Constitution concerns the Illinois State Militia.

A **militia**, consists of citizens eligible for military service. In Illinois, the Illinois State Militia "consists of all abled-bodied persons residing in the State except those exempt by the law" (Article Twelve, Section One).

The Illinois State Militia includes an organized and an unorganized militia. The Illinois National Guard is the State's organized, and currently active, militia and it is federally recognized. The Illinois National Guard, as well as the National Guards in other states, can be called into service by the President of the United States or the Congress of the United States to assist the federal government and the U.S. Military branches in responding to moments of crisis.

Because the Illinois National Guard can be called into service by the federal government, the Military Code of Illinois ([10 ILCS 1805](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs5.asp?ActID=315&ChapterID=0)) and the Illinois State Guard Act ([20 ILCS 1815](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs4.asp?DocName=002018150HPt%2E+I&ActID=317&ChapterID=5&SeqStart=100000&SeqEnd=500000)) allow the Governor of Illinois to call an unorganized, volunteer militia—the Illinois State Guard—into service. The Governor of Illinois may activate the Illinois State Guard to enforce the laws of the state, to serve the State of Illinois when the Illinois National Guard is unavailable due to war or federal service, and during times of emergency.

The Governor of Illinois is the Commander-in-Chief of both the organized militia (the Illinois National Guard) and the unorganized militia (the Illinois State Guard), except when the Illinois National Guard is asked to work in service of the United States. If the Illinois National Guard is working in service of the federal government, the President of the United States is the temporary Commander-in-Chief of the Illinois National Guard.

Citizens can be asked to volunteer for the Illinois State Guard in times of crisis, but they cannot be forced, under Illinois State Law. The Illinois State Guard Act ([20 ILCS 1815](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs4.asp?DocName=002018150HPt%2E+I&ActID=317&ChapterID=5&SeqStart=100000&SeqEnd=500000)) allows the Governor of Illinois to issue a proclamation calling for volunteers to serve in the State Guard during times of crisis.

The Illinois State Guard volunteer pool includes any individuals included in the unorganized militia — which are Illinois citizens aged 18 through 45. If necessary, the Governor of Illinois can also include individuals aged 45 to 65.


### General Provisions

Article Thirteen of the Illinois Constitution provides general requirements for election to public office. Furthermore, this Article requires public officials to solemnly swear to faithfully serve the State of Illinois by conducting their duties to the best of their abilities.

All candidates for public office, all elected officials, and all members of a Commission or Board created by the Illinois Constitution are required to file a verified statement of their economic interests. The Governmental Ethics Act further requires certain state employees — those who are supervisors or who manage state contracts and funds — to provide a statement of economic interest each year. In statements of economic interests, individuals list any conflicts of interest they might have based on businesses they own, professional organizations they manage or serve on, lobbyists they are associated with, and so on. These economic interest statements are filled with the Illinois Secretary of State's Office and are available for the public to see on the [Secretary of State's website](https://apps.ilsos.gov/economicinterest).

Each elected official in Illinois must take an oath or affirmation to uphold the U.S. Constitution and the Illinois Constitution and to faithfully conduct the duties of their office to the best of their abilities. Some religious faiths do not allow their members to swear oaths, but allow them to make affirmations. An oath is a declaration made to God or another Higher Power, while an affirmation is a declaration made based on the individual's personal honor. Both oaths and affirmations are solemn promises and both have the same legal effect.

The State of Illinois is able to be sued per Article Thirteen, Section Four of the Illinois Constitution. This section abolishes **sovereign immunity** which would prohibit the State of Illinois from being sued without its consent.

### Constitutional Revision

Article Fourteen of the Illinois Constitution concerns the revisioning of the Constitution of the State of Illinois

Article Fourteen of the Illinois Constitution gives the Illinois General Assembly the authority to ask voters whether a Constitutional Convention should be held if three-fifths of the members elected to each house agree to ask.

If the Illinois General Assembly does not call to ask voters whether a Constitutional Convention is necessary during a twenty-year period, the question is automatically asked during the election in the twentieth year.

If a Constitutional Convention is called, two delegates are sent to the Convention from each legislative district. At the Constitutional Convention, the delegates determine whether the Illinois Constitution should be revised or if any amendments should be proposed. If the Constitutional Convention determines revisions or amendments are needed, the Convention calls an election and the people are asked to vote on whether the amendments or revisions should become effective. If a majority of those voting approve the changes, they become part of the Illinois Constitution.

The Illinois General Assembly may also suggest amendments for the Illinois Constitution by the vote of three-fifths of the members elected to each house. Amendments recommended in this way by the General Assembly must also be approved at the general election by either three-fifths of those voting on the separate ballot containing the amendment(s) or a majority of those voting in the election.

The General Assembly's ability to suggest amendments is limited in a few ways:

1. The General Assembly cannot submit proposed amendments to more than three Articles of the Illinois Constitution at one time.
2. The General Assembly cannot propose amendments that will affect its own structure or procedures. In other words, the General Assembly does not have the authority to propose amendments to Article IV of the Illinois Constitution.


Article Fourteen, Section Four of the Illinois Constitution specifies that three-fifths of the members elected to both houses of the Illinois General Assembly are required to vote to:

1. Approve a request for a United States Constitutional Convention,
2. Ratify a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution, or
3. Call a State Convention to ratify a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution.
