## Lewis Theory of Covalent Bonding

Atoms can achieve an octet by sharing valence electrons with other atoms

Covalent bonds are **directional**.

The more electrons two atoms share, the shorter the bond should be.
Bond length is determined by measuring the distance between nuclei of the bonded atoms.

In general, triple bonds are shorter than double, and is correspondingly weaker too.

## Bond Polarity

Bonds have a degree in sharing and some degree of ion formation.
Unequal sharing results in a *dipole*.


## Electronegativity

The ability to attract electrons is called **electronegativity**.

Goes from top-right to bottom-left.

The larger the difference, the more polar the bond.

Polar bond greater than 0.4 is a *polar covalent bond*.
If less, then it is a *pure covalent bond*.

## Criticism with the Lewis Theory

The Lewis Theory does not give good numerical predictions (bond strength and length) .
