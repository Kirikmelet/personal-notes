## Lewis Theory of Covalent Bonding

Atoms can achieve an octet by sharing valence electrons with other atoms

Covalent bonds are **directional**.

The more electrons two atoms share, the shorter the bond should be.
Bond length is determined by measuring the distance between nuclei of the bonded atoms.

In general, triple bonds are shorter than double, and is correspondingly weaker too.

## Bond Polarity

Bonds have a degree in sharing and some degree of ion formation.
Unequal sharing results in a *dipole*.


## Electronegativity

The ability to attract electrons is called **electronegativity**.

Goes from top-right to bottom-left.

The larger the difference, the more polar the bond.

Polar bond greater than 0.4 is a *polar covalent bond*.
If less, then it is a *pure covalent bond*.

## Formal Charge

Covalent compounds do not have ions, hence using **formal charge**, an ionic structure must be assumed.

$$\text{Total no. of Valence Electrons}-(\text{Non-Bonding Electrons}+\text{no. of bonds})$$

Better structures have:

- fewer formal charges
- smaller fomrla charges
- have the negative formal charge on the more electronegative atom

### Resonance

When the Lewis Structure of the compound contains delocalisation, this is called
**resonance**.

## Octet Rule Exceptions

- Odd number electrons species
	- Will have one unpaired electron
	- free-radical
	- very reactive
- Incomplete octets
	- B, Al
- Expanded octets
	- Elements with empty d orbitals can have more than eight electrons.
		- Only elements in group 3+
		
## Bond Energy

Otherwise known as bond enthalpy: the amount of energy it takes to break one mole of a bond in the gas phase.

$\Delta H\degree_{rxn}$ 

## Bond Length

The distance between nuclei of the bonded atoms.

Normally, the **average bond length** is found.

## Criticism with the Lewis Theory

The Lewis Theory does not give good numerical predictions (bond strength and length) .
