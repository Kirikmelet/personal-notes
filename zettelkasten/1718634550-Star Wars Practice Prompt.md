# Star Wars Practice Prompt

Who has never watched the Star Wars series? For whom have yet, the amount of films and shows can make the average viewer confused to what order to watch the films; or whether or not the films are even canon in the first place ("Source B";"Source H"). The "Rotten Tomatoes", a popular review website, has argued that the best way to consume Star Wars is to watch the films and television shows in chronological order from episode one all the way to episode nine with the spin-off television shows in the middle (Source B). This is also supported by a popular image from a Star Wars internet forum that listed all the movies in chronological order (Source C). Controversially, Jason Cohen from the PCMag magazine has supported a "Machete Order", where the viewer starts with episode four, before watching episodes two and three in-between episode five and six to create a flashback effect. In this order, the sequel trilogy can be viewed separately, and episode one and others are its own anthology (Source I). In general, is is most preferred by many to watch the show in a chronological order; and while the "Machete Order" posits and interesting alternative, can pose to be too confusing for the new viewer to handle. And as such, the standard chronological order remains the best way to enjoy Star Wars.
