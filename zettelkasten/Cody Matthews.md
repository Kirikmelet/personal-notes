# Cody Matthews

Cody Matthews (1935-), was a Senior Patrol Officer of the Noobic Military Police. Cody was born to a middle class family in the capital city of the Noobic Stratocracy, Novis Bellum, and was an only child. Cody graduated from the Stratocratic Military Academy into the Noobic Military Police. In the Reunification War (1961-1967), Cody was transferred to the Naramo District office in 1963, shortly before the Raid of the Naramo Nuclear Power Plant.

Cody was present during the raid, and valiantly defended the plant alongside his fellow officers. During the meltdown, Cody was amongst the last to enter the nuclear bunker, which commended him a medal for his bravery.
