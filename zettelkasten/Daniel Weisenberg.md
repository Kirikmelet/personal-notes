# Daniel Weisenberg

Daniel Wesienberg (1938-), was a Patrol Sargent of the Noobic Military Police (NMP). Daniel was born in the border regions of Minerva, of which his father was permanently garrisoned at with the 308th Infantry Battalion before the Reunification War (1961-1967). Daniel enlisted in the Noobic Interior Service, with an occupational specialty in the NMP. After completing cadet academy, Daniel served with outstanding performance and was quickly promoted before becoming a Patrol Sargent and reassigned to the NMP Naramo District office at the Naramo Nuclear Power Plant; which was previously believed to be a quaint assignment.

Daniel was notable during the Raid of the Naramo Nuclear Power Plant (1963) where he lead a squad of NMP officers and defended the coolant sector from assault groups of the Federal Noobic 21st Light Infantry Regiment, and strike forces from the Federal Noobic 36th Ranger Regiment.
