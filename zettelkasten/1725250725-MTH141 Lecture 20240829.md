## Linear, Compound, and Absolute Value Inequality

$<$, $>$, $<=$, $>=$, $\ne$, $\approx$

## Linear Inequality

This is an inequality of the form $ax+b=0$, where $=$ is subsituted with the inequalities $<$, $>$, $<=$, $>=$,
or any other "union" or "intersection" of the above form.

To solve inequalities we treat as a linear equation except when multiply/dividing both sides by a negative value we reserve the inequality symbol.

Relationship is preserved when:

- Adding to both sides.
- Subtracting to both sides.
- Multiplying to both sides, **unless when with negative numbers**.
- Dividing to both sides, **unless when with negative numbers**.

> $a < x < b$ is equivalent to $x>a$ or $x<b$.
> The aformentioned is a "union". 

- Interval Notation: $(-2,\frac{6}{5}]$
- Set-Builder Notation $\{x|-2<x<=\frac{6}{5}\}$

## Absolute Value Inequalities

An absolute value inequality is an inequality that contains absolute value

Consider $|x-2|<3$:

1. $|x-2|$ refers to the distance between $x$ and $2$, hence it is $-1$.
2. $|x-2|$ is less than $3$.
3. Thus the answer is $[1, 3]$ if in interval notation.$

In general, $|x|<a$ and $a>c$, in the form of $|x-c|<a$

Hence you are able to write $-a<x<a$


### Theorums

1. If $|x|=a$ and $a>0$, then $x=a$ or $x=-a$.
2. If $|x|<a$ and $a>0$, then $-a<=x<=a$.
3. If $|x|>=a$ and $a>=0$, then $x<=-a$ or $x>a$
