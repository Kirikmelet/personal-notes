# Natural Economy

Also known as "Economy in Kind"

Natural economies are those in
which money and markets play no role in the allocation of goods; there
is no common unit of calculation, no price, and accounting instead takes
place in terms of a good or service’s usefulness, described vis-àvis the
magnitude of its physical properties.

(People's Republic of Walmart, p. 25-26)
