# CHM121 Lecture 20240925

## Acid-Base and Gas-Evolution Reactions


### Acid-Base Reactions

Acids will produce an $\ce{H^+}$ ion when dissolved in water. During the ionisation process, the components share an electron. 

Bicarbonate ions in acid-base reactions produce $\ce{CO_2}$.

Acid-base reactions produce water, most of the time.

Also called *neutralisation reaction*

### Gas-Evolution Reaction

Gasses are produced, resulting in bubbles.

## Oxidation-Reduction Reactions

Also as "redox reactions", is when electrons are displaced from one to another. Aka, when the oxidation state is modified.

- Increase is an oxidation.
- Decrease is a reduction.


## Oxidation States

Free floating elements in a reaction have an oxidation state of 0. In compounds, the oxidation states cancel out.
