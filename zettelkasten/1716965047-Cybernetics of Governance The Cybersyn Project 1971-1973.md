# 1716965047-Cybernetics of Governance The Cybersyn Project 1971-1973

## 解題

## 引く

> System 1, S1, was an operational system, the one
producing the system’s products. System 2, S2, was an anti-oscillatory function to
82
coordinate the operational units of System 1. System 3, S3, distributed and opti-
mized the use of resources within the viable system. System 4, S4, was responsi-
ble for the system’s adaptation to its environment, and System 5, S5, was respon-
sible for policy-making (Beer 1972)

## ノート

- Modeled after Stafford Beer's "Viable Model System"
	- Modeled after human central nervous system (p. 3)
- Had a recursive system (p. 3) - See quote 1 above
- Utilizes "Variety Engineering" (p. 3)
	- Is supposed to ignore unimportant notes, yet keep significant changes to system
- Platform was based on Actualities (ACT), Capabilities (CAP), and Potentialities (POT) (p. 3)
- "Cyberstride" was name of software used for processing data
- Cybernet was instrumental in overcoming external/internal threats to system (p. 6)
	- P/N: Redundency capable
- Managing complexity of system was difficult to implement (p. 9)
	- Caused cybernetics and organization of system to be weak (p. 9)
- Cyberstride was weak in handling dynamic capabilities which lead to incapability to respond to environmental changes (p. 10)
- Project Cybersyn emphasized on operational complexity > organizational complexity (p. 10)
	- Meant that lack of lateral coordination between plants/enterprises.
- Ahead of its time (p. 10)
	- Didn't have technology that enable greater and easier coordination we have today
