The short essay “Shooting an Elephant” by famed author George Orwell contains several
fascinating propositions. One of which comes to mind: imperialism, a horrible injustice committed upon
the oppressed peoples of the world.
Imperialism – an act now considered so despicable – was a notable period in the history of the
world: especially so during Orwell’s service in the British colony of Burma, then a part of British India.
In Orwell’s essay, he describes how not one person “had the guts to raise a riot, but if a European woman
went through the bazaars alone somebody would probably spit betel juice over her dress.”, and how there
“were several thousands of them in the town and none of them seemed to have anything to do except
stand on street corners and jeer at Europeans.” Thus explicitly qualifying how imperialism is a negative
force. Further in the essay, Orwell noted how in order to uphold the imperialist oppression, the white man
is forced into a mold of sorts: warranted by Orwell’s remark in how “in trying to impress the ‘natives,’”,
the European is forced to “do what the ‘natives’ expect of him” whenever there is a crisis; later on
collaborated by why the “white man mustn’t be frightened in front of ‘natives’; and so, in general, he isn’t
frightened.” Albeit, it is noteworthy that Orwell at that time was the only person carrying a rifle, and that
“the people expected it of me and I had got to do it.” Be that is it may be, it is also equally noteworthy to
note that Orwell was in the British colony of Burma at the time; and that it would have been rational that
rifles were generally equipped by Europeans. This portrayal of imperialism is further backed by how
Orwell’s younger European comrade viewed the elephant as having more value than ‘any damn
Coringhee coolie’”; his older European comrade gave zero considerations about the Indian owner because
“he was only an Indian and could do nothing”; so did Orwell himself remark that he “was very glad that
the coolie had been killed” and that it “gave me a sufficient pretext for shooting the elephant.” “Every
Dwijanto 2
white man’s life in the East, was one long struggle not to be laughed at.” – is another quote from Orwell
commenting on how imperialism is an antagonistic factor. Orwell defends that phrase by stating how
“perceived in this moment that when the white man turns tyrant it is his own freedom that he destroys,”
and that “he becomes a sort of hollow, posing dummy, the conventionalized figure of a sahib…. I had
committed myself to doing it when I sent for the rifle. A sahib has got to act like a sahib; he has got to
appear resolute, to know his own mind and do definite things.” Contrasted by how “did not want to shoot
the elephant,” Orwell felt that imperialism was weighing down on his moral values and beliefs. Orwell
afterwards adds how he “did not want to shoot the elephant…. It seemed to me that it would be murder to
shoot him.” Once the elephant was shot, “The Burmans were already racing past me across the mud…
Burmans were bringing dash and baskets even before I left, and I was told they had stripped his body
almost to the bones by the afternoon.” This suggests that maybe food was not very abundant, a
complication that could have been exacerbated by imperialism. Ergo, Orwell “was not thinking
particularly of my own skin, only of the watchful yellow faces behind;” meaning that Orwell felt forced to
do his duty in service to imperialism – id est, the imperialism in “Shooting an Elephant”.
